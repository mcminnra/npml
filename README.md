# No Packages Machine Learning

Data Science and Machine Learning library written (almost) entirely without packages.  The goal is to implement various utilities, algorithms, and other useful tools without the use of common libraries like scikit, tensorflow, etc. Any function that doesn't come from the Python Standard Library is expected to be explictly implemented in the library. This package is meant to be a learning opportunity, and will not meet up to performance expectations when compared to other popular ML packages.
